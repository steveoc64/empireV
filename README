This is a web application for managing games of Empire V.

Empire V is a really old school set of wargaming rules for running Napoleonic era
wargames with miniatures.

Its a product of the 70s / 80s ... so there are stacks of charts, lots of maths, 
and huge number of very strict ifs, buts and  procedures in playing the game.

There is even a 2 page flowchart in the rules for working out what happens after 2 
groups of infantry come close to each other, after the defender has fired at the 
attacking troops, after casualties and morale checks, but before the attacking
troops close for the final contact.  2 pages of flowcharts just for that !

Thats just to give an idea of the depth and complexity of the rules.


Now, in the modern tabletop gaming era, there are some excellent new rules out
that are a lot easier to play, and provide fun games at levels from battalion to
Corps. The market is quite healthy.

So why bother with a 30+ year old rule set ?

Well, because at the end of the day, Empire remains very popular with the so called
hard core gamers, because it actually provides a highly realistic experience of
fighting battles in this period, and produces highly plausible results.

So much so, that the community of wargamers who enjoy this period remain quite 
loyal to this venerable masterpeice of a ruleset.

Sso here we have a modernization of this excellent system, in the form of an 
extremely easy to use computer moderated control system.

Hopefully this will serve the hard core gamers well, and also provide an 
exciting and innovative path to allow the new generation of gamers to enjoy 
the benefits of gaming Napoleonics in the beautiful old school way.

Art meets Science.

To run this, you need to set the system up on a web server, and then setup the data, and
then create user accounts for accessing the game for various players. 

The best way to do this is setup a linux machine with Apache/PHP/MySQL support (all standard
utilities that are part of a general linux install), and then simply install this application.

That machine then runs the whole virtual world that the battle is fought in. Each player then
communicates with their troops in that battle via a web server.

Remember that ANYTHING with a web browser can access the system, so you could use a bunch of
laptops on a wireless LAN, ipads, smartphones, etc.

Its all standard HTML and javascript - NO Flash, NO activeX .. so that allows for the use of ipads !!

What this system does (or will do) :

General Game Setup and Management :
- Provides a web based application for running a set of games.
- The system will load and store a large database of detailed orders of battle for various armies.
- Create a large database of scenarios, that use subsets of the orders of battle.
- Spawn any number of games based on these scenarios. The system manages which games are in progress, 
  and stores all state information related to each game move permanently.


Player Control :
- Manage multiple user accounts for access to the system with various different roles.
- Administrator can assign players to games in progress, allowing complicated setups of sub-commands.
- Manage access to information on the system .. each player is locked down to operating within only
  those units under their command, in the context of a given game that is running.
- Each game has at least 1 user setup as the umpire for that game. The umpire controls the flow
  of the game from one phase to the next, one turn to the next.

This allows games to be run in a number of different ways, really depending on how many 
computers you can dig up. 

Some examples :

- 2 players - 1 controlling each side, plus an umpire to control the game. 
- 2 players at a table. One is running as the umpire/player for one side, the other is running as a player only for the other side.
- 2 players at a table. Both are up to scratch with the system, so they are both running as umpire / player.
- 1 player running a solo game, so he is logged in as administrator with access to both sides.

- A really big game with over 10 players a side. Commands allocated to various Corps, Divisions, or even Brigades to
individual players. The system will ensure that each player can only access and control those units under their
command structure.

- Monstrous convention, with a dozen games in progress on a number of tables, each table having a dozen players on
each side. Huge !  The system will happily manage running multiple games at the same time. A pig to admin maybe, 
but technically the system can handle it from a single machine running a single web server.


Running the Game (Player)
- 



Variable Scaling Support :
- Each game can be run at any scaling factor. By default it uses 1:60 figure scale and 1"=40y ground scale.
  However the game scale can be set to any arbitary values in order to accomodate whatever fits the
  size of each battle. 
- Information inside the system is calculated and stored in terms of actual troops. However, information presented
  back to the umpire in terms of figures, and information presented to the players is in terms of bases of troops.
  Details on distances are presented in terms of inches. These calculations are all done on the fly based
  on the current scaling.
- Scaling can be changed in mid-game if needed. ie - If a battle starts as a skirmish action at 1:15 scale
  between a couple of battalions ... and then escalates into a larger general battle ... 

Requirements :

- A standard web server with PHP support and mySQL support.
- Too easy ... just grab any old linux box and get it running. 
- A couple of GIG of RAM and a few 100MB of disk space will be way more than enough to run the system.
- An old P-III from the hard rubbish collection will have sufficient grunt to run a game with multiple players, no worries.


----oOo----

Future Path :

I know there are a number of decent computer moderated wargaming tools out 
there, but this one is aimed at being 100% faithful to the EmpireV rules -
warts and all.

There are many areas of the game that might be able to be improved and 
extended, but the intention with this project is to simply capture the
essennce of playing Empire, and nothing more or less than that.

No shortcuts, no optimisations on the gaming - just a faithful capture of
the rules in the all of their glorius details, with a computer interface on it.

Get as close to the original as is possible .. and thats it. 


However, it doesnt end there !!

Will be adding a campaign framework around this as a separate project
later on. More on that later.

Once this one is fully complete and polished up to perfection, it also
happens to provide an excellent framework for hacking together other 
systems around other rulesets.

I will probably look at forking this as a number of completely separate
projects that are customised to a number of other gaming rulesets.

Some ideal candidates are :

- Piquet ... having a computerised interface on the whole initiative and card system.
- IABSM, and all the other lardies products which use card activation.
- Big scale operational wargaming in 3mm/6mm scale for huge WW2 or modern battles.


Should be a fun ride.

Remote Wargaming

This will be cool to do, but I have not quite worked out the best way to handle it yet.

The idea is to have a game in progress at a table somewhere in the world, with a webcam or
2 setup on the table, and then delegate some commander positions to users who happen to
be on the other side of the world.

The interaction with their units is all through the web interface anyway, so that will work
fine without any modification. Maybe having the webcams on the table with live views of the
tabletop will be good enough to allow those remote players to experience 'being there' at
the battle with their online mates.

I havent designed that aspect into the system yet, but its something I really want to 
add at some point down the track. I dont see any technical obstacle to being able to do this.

Its more a question of whether the remote player will really 'feel' part of the game, and that
comes downs to having really good fast communication, and possibly live streamed audio as well.
Its not just the pretty pictures, bad die rolls, and detailed AARs that make a game ... its the
chit chat, jokes and laughter that all need to happen in real time to make it work.

If I could stream the audio from both ends of the connection as well as the webcam feed,
then it would work brilliantly I think.

Legal Aspects and Licence terms in plain English :


The development of this application is strictly intended as a bold statement
for how to write a good multi-user computer moderated wargaming system.

It is provided as free (as in free speech) software, allowing anyone to 
download and use with full access to all of the source code. It is therefore 
published under a variety of free software licences. 

There is NO CHARGE for providing this software, so its also free software as in
free beer. 

This might strike some people as odd, but the concept is not new, and it has
proven to be the best approach to developing seriously good software. If the
software has merit, then a community of developers will naturally grow around
the available source code, share updates, and generally start to do really 
cool things with it. 

This software only exists because it is based on a number of freely available
components. All I have done is to take various libraries of code written by
other people, and add my own layer of code on top to create this application.

The application as a whole then contains the work of innumerable authors, all
of whom have granted free (as in free speech) access to their work.

These freedoms are inherited by any derived product from this source code.

Commercial opportunity ?

This creates a commercial opportunity for providing this software as a service,
if so desired.

Anyone that wants to run this software as a commerical operation, say .. providing
a web service for a fee to run wargames .. is free to do so under the terms
of the licence. Consent to do so is implied in the licence terms.

You may also modify the software in any way you see fit in order to satisfy your
customers. You have permission to do that under the terms of the licence as well.

If there is demand for it, and it is economically viable to do so ... then I may
setup such a service online to run wargames and campaigns from one of my servers 
for other players to run games from.
